# Drone-controller-sleeve
A circuit designed to send commands to a drone that it controls. The inputs to the circuit that determine the commands come from six separate tribo-electric nanogenerators (TENG). The materials used for the TENG were aluminium foil and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). The aluminium foil was arranged as six squares that sat on a sleeve that was secured to the users forearm. The aluminium squares were connected to electrodes that were inputs to the circuit. A glove was used with FEP material on the fingertips, and so when the user touched the aluminium squares on the sleeve, a voltage was created in the aluminium squares.
The six aluminium squares were controlls that were responsible for increasing or decreasing the values of roll, pitch, and yaw of the drone.
A Raspberry Pi Pico was used to determine the exact messages that could be sent to the HC-12 transceiver that would transmitt the commands to the drone.
